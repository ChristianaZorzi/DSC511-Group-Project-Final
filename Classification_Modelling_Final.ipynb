As you enter the restaurant, it has that cozy kitchen dining atmosphere (you seat yourself) and there is a TV on with Mexican programming. There are usually a few lunch specials on the board as well as an everyday lunch menu with good prices. I like the complementary chips and salsa here. The homemade fried chips are very large and crispy and the salsa is good too. I've ordered the Tacos, Burritos, Pupusas, and Chimichangas, which are served with Mexican rice and refried beans. In general, the Mexican fare here is just average.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |2007-03-01 00:36:06|Framingham       |neutral                |\n",

The service in the bar area was beyond terrible. They really needed another 2 waitresses. We sat down Saturday at 8p and we waited 30 minutes before we even received a menu. Another 20 min before we ordered a drink. When the drinks came we immediately ordered dinner because we knew if we didn't we would be there a very long time. After receiving dinner, I could not believe a hamburger at a steak restaurant could be so well-done. I asked for another hamburger cooked medium rare as I ordered, but after waiting 10 minutes, we just decided to get the check for our drinks and leave. Wouldn't you know like 2-3 waiters came over immediately and removed the salad and french fries as they wanted to make sure we didn't eat. Definitely a disaster and will never return.  \\n\\nBtw, this is my second yelp review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |2019-11-24 05:26:05|Framingham       |negative               |\n",

We went for breakfast and had the eggs benedict with canadian bacon and the corned beef hash. The holandaise sauce was unfortunately way (way!) too lemony and the canadian bacon too thick/dry. The corned beef hash was great - with the exception of the corned beef (sausage, bacon, eggs, potatoes were great), which looked and tasted no different from canned one. Coffee was average.

The beer was pretty good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |2019-02-20 15:27:01|Framingham       |negative               |\n",

The service was slow. There were only a few full tables in the whole restaurant and it took about 5 mins to get our drinks. I ordered the sour blueberry cooler soda which was delicious. The only issue was it was $4.50 for this tiny glass which was filled 3/4 of the way with ice. For an appetizer I got to try the hoison pork belly. I liked it but I feel like the sauce didn't go with it that well. I'm happy they had it though because I can never find pork belly anywhere. I ended up getting the tuna tartare and a fish taco. The tuna wasn't bad but the sesame chips that came with it were way too salty. I love salty foods but these chips were like licking table salt. Last and most certainly least is the fish taco. It's only $4 per taco but you end up seeing why. When you look inside it you can see a burnt tortilla with a mound of below average slaw. On top of the slaw holds a bite sized piece of delicious fried fish. It also had a little bit of spicy sauce which was actually too spicy ( I like spicy foods too). If the slaw to fish ratio was switched I would have probably ordered another taco. I would not come here again for the food but I would definitely be back for the sour blueberry cooler soda, it was unbelievable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |2017-01-13 00:03:08|Framingham       |negative               |\n",

If this review was for the drinks, I'd say they were fine.\\n\\nDinner however was a little weird. My friend ordered salmon on her salad that as she got to the middle was just about RAW. I had a salad that tasted like the salad wasn't very fresh. It took forever to hound a server down re: my friend's fish, and he took it back to the kitchen. Almost 30 min later they bring a new fish, but no salad.. just a small plate with nothing but the salmon.

I've tasted some phenomenal IndoChinese food in South India, New York and New Jersey.  I'm always ready to try a new venue so when my family & friends decided to try Chinese Mirch I was excited to see what these mixed reviews were all about. \\nLet me say that I think the food is pretty good and creative. \\nI like that the dishes weren't bland food soaked in a myriad of sauces to disguise the flavor deficit. I would have ordered spicier dishes but I kept it conservative given everyone had different levels of tolerance.  \\nWe tried the Gobi Lollipops, the szchuan fried rice, eggplant paneer, chilli paneer and hot and sour soup. Again, I think the flavor was good and paneer of good quality but I would have preferred a spicier dish for my Indian palate. \\nI was intrigued by the Chaat Gaali cart and would have loved to try some of their creative options but alas it is not available on the weekends as the chef is off.  \\nAmbience/Service: Parking was limited in the front but there's a sign indicating rear parking is also available. Well designed and pleasant interior decor. Seating wasn't cramped and our group of 8 was quite comfortable. We came in at 12:30 on a Sat and were seated immediately. There were several other families there. Our waiter approached us for an order at a reasonable time and the food was brought out at a decent time interval (not too soon and not too long).  Food was warmer than warm but not piping hot. For dessert we shared the wonton mithai, gulab jamun, assorted mochi, and rasamali.  Nothing was extraordinary but most was the jamun and rasamali were decent enough if you're craving some sweet. \\nI was, however, disappointed with the indian chai. Several Indian restaurants are putting chai on  their menus but upon further inquiry I've been told that it's nothing more than a regular teabag. If you're expecting real Indian Chai make sure you ask!\\nThis isn't as good as some of the other places I've been to but I certainly didn't think it's as bad as some of the other reviews seemed to indicate. \\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend and try this place again.|2014-07-06 16:05:00|Framingham       |positive               |\n",

The few dedicated employees are SO out weighted by those who are clueless and who really do not care about trying at all but getting an undeserved tip. The barmaid was at the mercy of a waiter to deliver our salsa and chips, 10 minutes passed by. I felt so badly for her, for she tried so hard but could not leave her station. I went out side for some air, and the hostess came out and asked me if I saw \"anyone who looked like they were waiting for take-out!\" OMG I am thinking, they actually have advertised \"curb-side-take-out!\" I then identified the car, and she was so happy I did her a favor. When she walked back up, she said, \"I have to tell MY MANAGER about this service!!!!!!!!\" AGAIN......OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Then our so-called waiter, \"Justin\" put the frosting on the Mexican cake! I had ordered a glass of wine and a glass of water, kind of easy, right? 20 Minutes go by and then I finally saw our waiter, Justin, I asked him what was going on; he was very quick to say that  the bar was understaffed and he would go back and check. If that was truly the case, why did I still not have my water?, does that come from the bar too?  OWN IT JUSTIN! Then, I was asked to score our experience and food, I was glad to do, and actually saw the hostess throw it out in the trash. WILL NEVER GO THER AGAIN OR EVER RECOMMEND. They obviously do not know what is important in the current day of customer satisfaction, when we are all trying to attract forever clients.

The customer service isn't great (which is honestly what Chik-fi-A is known for, outside of its amazing chicken). The real reason behind the 2-star rating is because I've been trying to get a hold of someone about hosting a birthday party there for close to a week and absolutely no one will get back to me. I've called, emailed, FB messaged and even stopped by the location and I can't get anyone to give me any answers.
