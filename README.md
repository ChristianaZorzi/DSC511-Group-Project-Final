## Restaurant Reviews Pre and Post Covid
### Rafaela Christou,  Christiana Zorzi, Emili Rousou, Vasiliki Christodoulou
Our dataset was sourced from Kaggle and included two CSV files containing restaurant reviews from the pre- and post-COVID periods. The main goal of our analysis was to examine how customer interactions and behavior changed over time.\
As an initial step, we loaded both datasets and inspected them for any missing values. Both contained missing values, but we only removed the missing values from reviews that occured in pre dataset. Furthermore, we dropped the duplicate reviews. Through research, we found out that COVID-19 in USA started on January 20, so the the 31633 reviews that were written before 20/01 on post-Covid, were transferred to the pre-Covid dataset.\
Moving on to the location analysis, we noticed that the column 'city' contained more unique entries than expected. This was because similar city names were treated as different values â€” for example, "St.Cloud" and "St. Cloud" were considered distinct. During our analysis, we also discovered that a province code was incorrectly recorded. Specifically, there is no state called "ABE" in the USA. Upon inspecting the restaurants labeled with this code, we found out that they were actually located in Vancouver. Therefore, we corrected the province code from "ABE" to "BC". Furthermore, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine the variables and compare the differences between the two datasets over time. Detailed informations are shown in the code file. \
We also performed LDA for topic detection in the pre- and post-Covid datasets, in order to find the dominant topics.\
For the modeling phase, we performed sentiment analysis on the reviews column and with an 5% sample of the pre-Covid dataset. We trained a Logistic Regression on training dataset. Firstly, the reviews were categorized into positive, neutral, or negative based on their star ratings, and only English reviews were retained using language detection. Also, we preprocessed the text by tokenizing, removing stopwords, applying HashingTF, and computing TF-IDF features. A pipeline was built combining all preprocessing steps with the Logistic Regression model, which was trained on 80% of the data and evaluated on the remaining 20% using the F1-score. More information can be found in the file of the model. (Classification_Modelling_Final.ipynb)\
We followed two approaches. In the first one, we manually chosen features for the logistic regression. These are the review counts, stars, state, which we encoded them with one-hot-encoding and, of course, reviews. In the second approach, we followed a similar path, however we used just the reviews column.\
Finally, we also did Recommendation Systems with Alternating Least Squares (ALS), which basically performs collaborative filtering using the User ID, Business ID and customer stars to recommend restaurants to the users.
