Our dataset was sourced from Kaggle and included two CSV files containing restaurant reviews from the pre- and post-COVID periods. The main goal of our analysis was to examine how customer interactions and behavior changed over time.\\
As an initial step, we loaded both datasets and inspected them for any missing values. Both contained missing values, but we only removed the missing values from reviews that occured in pre dataset. Furthermore, we dropped the duplicate values. Through research, we found out that COVID-19 in USA started on January 20, so the the 31633 reviews that were written before 20/01 on post covid, were transferred to the pre covid dataset.\\
Moving on to the location analysis, we noticed that the city column contained more unique entries than expected. This was because similar city names were treated as different values â€” for example, "St.Cloud" and "St. Cloud" were considered distinct. During our analysis, we also discovered that a province code was incorrectly recorded. Specifically, there is no state called "ABE" in the USA. Upon inspecting the restaurants labeled with this code, we found they were actually located in Vancouver. Therefore, we corrected the province code from "ABE" to "BC". Furthermore, we performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine the variables and compare the differences between the two datasets over time. Detailed informations are shown in the code file. \\
For the modeling phase we performed sentiment analysis on the reviews column and with an 1% sample of the pre-COVID dataset we trained a Logistic Regression on training dataset. Firstly, the reviews were categorized into positive, neutral, or negative based on their star ratings, and only English reviews were retained using language detection. Also, we preprocessed the text by tokenizing, removing stopwords, applying HashingTF, and computing TF-IDF features. A pipeline was built combining all preprocessing steps with the Logistic Regression model, which was trained on 80% of the data and evaluated on the remaining 20% using the F1-score.
